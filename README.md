# ECOLIFE: Carbon-Aware Serverless Function Scheduling for Sustainable Computing 

This repo contains the implementation of the Ant colony optimization algorithm. The file [aco.py](https://github.com/EmonRezaBD/Ecolife-Task/blob/main/aco.py) contains the implementation of this algorithm. 

Moreover, I completed this 02 weeks ago, and in the following revisions, I'll compare the results and further improvement of this codebase. 

Thank you for the opportunity.
